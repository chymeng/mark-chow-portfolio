      <h3>Retail Experience</h3>
      <h4>
        My experience in the retail industry has enabled to me develop my
        communication and interpersonal skills.
        <br />
        My years of experience have made me extremely comfortable working with
        personal and team targets. Working in the front stage of retail has also
        made me excellent at identifying the needs of customers and providing
        them with a positive customer experience.
        <br />I have developed leadership skills through my experience in the
        retail industry, especially in taking control of stressful situations
        and supporting my co-workers. My leadership skills have also been shown
        through developing new staff in the processes that we follow in the
        workplace.
